# 📊 COVID-19 Data Exploration and Visualization
This project explores global COVID-19 data using SQL Server and presents insights via Tableau Public dashboards. The dataset includes infection rates, death counts, population statistics, and vaccination trends.

## 🔍 SQL Analysis Overview
1. The SQL queries in this project cover: Basic filtering and sorting of COVID-19 cases and deaths

2. Comparative analysis:
  - Total Cases vs Total Deaths (to compute mortality rate)
  - Total Cases vs Population (to calculate infection percentage)

3. Identifying high-impact countries:

  - Countries with the highest infection or death rates

  - Continent-wise breakdown of total deaths

4. Rolling vaccination tracking using:

  - CTEs (Common Table Expressions)

  - Temporary tables

5. View creation for reusable queries: Queries used in Tableau visualizations to power key dashboard metrics

## 📈 Tableau Dashboard
A Tableau Public dashboard was created based on the above queries, featuring:

- Global COVID statistics

- Top countries by death count

- Infection percentages by population

- Daily trends over time
