#📊 COVID-19 Data Exploration and Visualization
This project explores global COVID-19 data using SQL Server and presents insights via Tableau Public dashboards. The dataset includes infection rates, death counts, population statistics, and vaccination trends.

##🔍 SQL Analysis Overview
The SQL queries in this project cover:

Basic filtering and sorting of COVID-19 cases and deaths

Comparative analysis:

Total Cases vs Total Deaths (to compute mortality rate)

Total Cases vs Population (to calculate infection percentage)

Identifying high-impact countries:

Countries with the highest infection or death rates

Continent-wise breakdown of total deaths

Rolling vaccination tracking using:

CTEs (Common Table Expressions)

Temporary tables

View creation for reusable queries

Queries used in Tableau visualizations to power key dashboard metrics

##📈 Tableau Dashboard
A Tableau Public dashboard was created based on the above queries, featuring:

Global COVID statistics

Top countries by death count

Infection percentages by population

Daily trends over time
